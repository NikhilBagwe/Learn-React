## Comments in JSX :

- Similar to how we write comments in JS.

```js
const HeaderComponent = () => {
  return(
    <div>
      {
        // Comment in JSX
      } 
      <h1>Functional Component</h1>
      <h3>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Aliquam, officiis!</h3>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Is JSX, ES6+ mandatory for React ?

- No it is not mandatory.
- React is very flexible library.
- We can also use React in a particular part of a website for example footer.
