## Intro :

- In our browser console, we get 'window' object from JS engine using which we can perform lot of tasks.
- Similarly in React we get all it's superpowers from the React code that we import using CDN link. The React code exports lots of functions. Once imported in our code, 
  now  we can access 'React, ReactDOM' object in console.
- In this tutorial, we will learn how to make our app production ready.

## Bundlers :

- To make our app production ready, we have to perform optimization, minify files, clear console log, etc.
- Bundler helps us to do this.
- Bundlers are used to reduce the size of the code and improve the performance of the application.
- The 'create-react-app' uses Webpack and Babel as bundler. But we will use Parcel.

## Parcel :

- Parcel is a bundler which basically is a package.
- A package is a JS module. 
- To install Parcel into our project we need a Package manager. 
- We use NPM for it.

### NOTE: NPM dosen't stand for Node package manager.
