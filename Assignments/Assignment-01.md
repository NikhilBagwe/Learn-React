## 1. What is Emmet ?

- Emmet is a free add-on/plugin for your text editor.
- It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code.
- By using Emmet, developers type less.
- While typing the Emmet Abbreviations, you can press "Ctrl + Space" see what will be generated(Inside a pop up)

### Example :
- Generate a div with text content inside them : div{This is a div}
- To generate nested we will use ‘>’ operator : ul>li
- Generate a list 3 li’s , each li has an anchor(a) tag : ul>li*3>a

## 2. Difference between a Library and Framework ?

- You have complete control over the application's flow when you use a "Library". You get to decide when and where you want to call the library.
- You can simply insert a Image carousel made using React in an plain HTML,CSS website.
- While when using a framework, the flow is controlled by the framework itself. It provides ready to use tools, standards, templates and we have to use them only .
- When an application code uses a library, the developer writing the code is in charge of the application flow. This means the developer decides when to call the library.
- However, when we use a framework, the framework decides when to call the library. This shift in control of calling the library from the application code to the framework is an inversion of control.

### Limitations of a Framework :

- Options to tweak functionalities are limited.
- Sometimes application development becomes complex
- Have to be up-to-date with new/deprecated features in every version.

### Limitations of a Library :

- Using a library means that our code is tied to that library.
- Using several libraries might impact the performance of an application adversely because of dependency conflicts.
- Sometimes libraries are vulnerable to malicious attacks.
